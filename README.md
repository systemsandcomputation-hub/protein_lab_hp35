# HP35 Phase-1 (Invariant Engine Domain #2)

This repo demonstrates Phase-1 results on Villin Headpiece (HP35) trajectories:

**Claim (Phase 1):**
Without energies or chemistry, we detect:
- folding regimes (coarse segments of stability)
- irreversible structural commitments (contacts that lock in)

Outputs include a single Phase-1 figure showing:
- window-to-window motif similarity
- regime boundaries
- commitment events as ticks

## What’s included
- Scripts to extract contact graphs (from the upstream HP35 dataset)
- Windowed regime detection
- Commitment detection
- A plotting script that generates the Phase-1 figure

## What’s not included
- Raw trajectory data (kept external for licensing/size reasons)
